## biotechnology for everyone  

Hello, my name is Kazuhide Hane.   
I am a medical student at Kobe University.  
I’m currently very interested in biotechnology.  

## our issue

If you suddenly want to start learning about bio-technology, how do you begin?  
Reading books? Searching the Internet?If you think It is not enough, What would you do?  
Conduct research in a university laboratory or find a job in a company?  
But  what about people who cannot access these resources because of some personal reason.How can they start bio-technology? 

Or  

If you don’t have curiosity about bio-technology, I think this is because you assume it is difficult and is not useful for you daily life. I want to talk to you about the  potential it has.  

## my solution
I recommend DIY bio, bio-hacking.  
It is a movement that is utilized not just by researchers, but citizens alike for biotechnology.  
I am a member of Tokyo DIY bio lab, and have already done gene-editing in my University.  
Currently you can join a DIY bio lab course only in Tokyo and Yamaguchi in Japan.  
I want to create a DIY bio lab in Kobe.  
DIY bio lab is a platform for both citizen and researchers studying and exploring biotechnology.  
You can create an affordable lab by making your own equipment. DIY bio lab is one solution for achieving goals for your personal project. It’s not necessary to buy expensive equipment.  

## your merit
If you are a programmer, you can innovate something by using your engineering skill.
If you are interested in the community, you can hold relationship building events. Such as making maccori, a handmade pro-biotic beverage.  
If you are interested in health and wellness, you can share knowledge acquired from your biohacking research with others to aid in sleep, nutrition, and meditation.  
If you are an artist, you can acquire the way of new expression, through your work you can show people a new future. 
If you are a biologist and want to explore something outside your expertise, you can freely enjoy biohacking without the structure of a course.  

## let's start biohacking
Let’s start making open-sourced bio-hacking kit.
